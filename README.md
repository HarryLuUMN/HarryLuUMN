## Bio

Hi, welcome to my webpage! My name is Yilin(Harry) Lu, and I’m pursuing my bachelor’s degree(with honors) at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. I'm a triple-major Computer Science, Mathematics, and Quantitative Economics student. I also minor in Statistical Science, emphasizing Astro-Informatics(Data Science in Astrophysics). Before college, I studied Mathematics at San Diego State University through the Dual Enrollment Option and graduated from Torrey Pines High School in California, USA. 

My current research interests are human-computer interactions, visualization, human-centered AI, and cognitive science. Currently, I’m primarily working with Prof. Qianwen Wang as a research & engineering lead at Visual Intelligence Lab, UMNTC. During my first freshman semester at the UMNTC, I was a science intern at TURBO Telescope Group at the Minnesota Institute for Astrophysics, where my work was crowdsourcing systems for science discovery, and my advisors were Prof. Patrick Kelly and Dr. Mandeep S Gill.
